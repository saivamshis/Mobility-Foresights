# Global Pt100 Temperature Sensor Market 2024-2030

The Pt100 temperature sensor market is going to flourish dramatically between 2024 and 2030. The increasing use of advanced technologies for the measurements of an accurate temperature in the industries has raised the demand for Pt100 sensors. This blog discovers some current trends, key drivers, challenges, and future prospects of the Pt100 temperature sensor market.

# Introduction to Pt100 Temperature Sensors

Pt100 temperature sensors, also called Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs), are one of the classes of temperature sensors that are commonly used for the accurate measurement of temperature in various industries. Basically, Pt100 sensors work by the concept that when the temperature around platinum increases, the electrical resistance of platinum will also increase. The "100" in Pt100 indicates that the sensor has 100 ohms of resistance when at 0Â°C. Pt100 sensors are known for high accuracy, stability, and repeatability, thus are used widely in arduous applications.
