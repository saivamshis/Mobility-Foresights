# Europe Plastomers Market 2022-2027

Europe plastomers market size has seen tremendous growth over the last couple of years. High demand from various end-use markets such as automotive, packaging, and healthcare has been the key driver of growth. Being able to derive both elastomer and traditional plastic characteristics, plastomers are used in applications demanding flexibility, durability, and exposure to harsh conditions. The trends, players, challenges, and prospects of the Europe plastomers market for 2022 to 2027 are discussed in this blog.

# Market Overview

# Definition of Plastomers

Plastomers are a family of thermoplastics that possess rubber-like properties and can be easily processed into many different forms, like regular plastics. This chemical exhibits tremendous elasticity along with chemical and UV light resistance. However, tensile strength is peerless. Some of the most commonly used plastomers include EOC (ethylene-octene copolymers) and EBC (ethylene-butene copolymers).

# Market Size and Growth

The Europe plastomers market was estimated to be around USD 1.2 billion in 2022. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 5% during the 2022-2027 forecast period. This growth is attributed to increased demand in end-use industries, technological advancements, and shifting toward sustainable materials.

# Key Market Drivers

1. Rising Demand in Packaging

The largest consumers of plastomers are the packaging industries. Increasing the sales of e-commerce and changing consumer preferences toward lightweight and eco-friendly packaging have given a significant boost to the demand for flexible, lightweight, and durable packaging solutions. Plastomers are excellent in sealing properties and are therefore preferably used in flexible films and containers.

2. Shift in Automotive Industry

Automotive companies are in a trend of light weighting the use of materials with an emphasis on fuel saving. Plastomers have migrated to the interior of the vehicle, exterior components, under the hood of vehicles, given its light weight and high performance features. The trend towards electric vehicles (EVs) is also creating a vast market for advanced products like plastomers.

3. Healthcare Applications

Healthcare segment demand for high-performance biocompatible material is one of the major growth drivers in the plastomers market. Medical appliances, pharmaceutical packing, and other health care products where flexibility, sterility, and chemical resistance are the requirements all use plastomers.
