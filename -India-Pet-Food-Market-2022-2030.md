Market Size and Growth: The Indian pet food market is growing rapidly, with estimates suggesting a growth rate of around 15-20% annually. This growth is driven by increasing pet ownership, urbanization, and rising disposable incomes.

Market Segmentation:

Dry Food: Dominates the market due to its affordability and convenience. It is the most commonly purchased type of pet food.

Treats and Supplements: Sales in this category are also rising as pet owners seek to provide additional care and enrichment for their pets.

Regional Variations: Urban centers like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai show higher sales volumes due to higher pet ownership rates and disposable incomes. Rural areas are gradually catching up, but the market penetration is still relatively lower.

# Current Challenges
