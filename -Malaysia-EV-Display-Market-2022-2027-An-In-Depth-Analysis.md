# Malaysia EV Display Market 2022-2027: An In-Depth Analysis

# Overview of Malaysia EV Market

The Malaysia automotive sector has emerged as one of the most promising for electric mobility. These moves by the government included the National Automotive Policy, 2020, and several other incentive programs to accelerate EV adoption. With growing electric vehicle sales, advanced displays for EVs used as vital interfaces by drivers and passengers would likely see increased demand proportionately.

# Key Trends in the EV Display Market

1. Technological Advancements

The EV display market represents one of the fastest-evolving technology fields in Malaysia. Advanced digital displays are replacing conventional analog displays, including touchscreen panels and HUDs. These advanced displays have improved functionality and the real-time presentation of vehicle information, navigation, and infotainment source integration. In the near future, the integration of AR and ADAS into the displays will continue to increase momentum and is expected to raise the driving experience to a whole new level.

2. Increasing Demand Due to Consumer Awareness

With growing environmental awareness and technological savviness among Malaysian consumers, electric vehicles along with their support technologies are gaining traction. With increasing demand for high-end displays in all vehicles that offer seamless connectivity and an intuitive user interface, this has forced automotive manufacturers to invest in advanced display technologies so as to deliver what the consumer expects and to stay ahead of the competition.

3. Government Policies and Incentives

The Malaysian government is encouraging electric vehicles through various initiatives and incentives, such as tax rebates and reduced import duties for EVs, subsidies on manufacturing, and the like. Such initiatives make the EVs cheaper not only for consumers but also attractive for companies that develop supporting technologies, including advanced EV displays. Supportive government policies toward carbon emission reductions and fostering sustainable transportation will continue to enhance demand for displays in EVs.

4. Increased Emphasis on Safety and Navigation

The features most associated with the driving experience have to do with safety and navigation. Advanced displays installed in modern EVs house real-time navigation, collision warning, and adaptive cruise control, among other features, for a more intuitive driving experience and safety for drivers. This integration of advanced safety and navigation features into the displays of EVs will continue to be emphasized even more as regulations around safety become increasingly stringent and as consumer expectations continue to rise.
