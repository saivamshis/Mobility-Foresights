In 2024, it was valued at around USD 1.5 billion. The growth trajectory is set to persist, with forecasts showing that the market will achieve approximately USD 3 billion by the year 2030. Furthermore, the expansion is fueled by developments in scanning technology, increased implementation within industries, and a rising demand for the realization of accurate 3D modeling.

# Key Drivers of Market Growth

Several reasons are soaring the demand for handheld 3D scanners' market. These are:

1. Technological Development

This growth is primarily driven by much more precise, faster, and user-friendly 3D scanners. These innovative technologies increase resolution and speed, which are increasing the usability of these devices. Real-time scanning, higher scanning speeds, and enhanced post-processing data are some of the new features that make the handheld 3D scanner ever more interesting for a wide range of customers.

2. Increased Adoption in Various Industries

Applications for handheld 3D scanners seem to pop out across industries, from automotive and aerospace to healthcare and architecture. For instance, in the automotive context, handheld 3D scanning serves the purposes of reverse engineering and quality control. In healthcare, detailed anatomical models are made of patients to help in planning surgeries and prosthetics. Another key growth driver is cross-industry adoption.

3. Growing Demand for Customized Products

This is the reason for the surge in demand for tailor-made and customized products, further driving the demand for accurate 3D scanning. Fashion and consumer goods industries are increasingly adopting the use of 3D scanners to offer custom-fit products and design prototypes. This is driving the market toward the development of more sophisticated and versatile scanning solutions.

4. Growth of AR and VR Technologies

With the growth in AR and VR technologies, opportunities for handheld 3D scanners are unfolding. Accurate 3D models have a high demand in the development of virtual worlds in AR and VR applications. The growth of 3D scanning is thus being complemented by AR/VR technologies, with the market witnessing growth on the basis of creating realistic 3D data that can help enterprises enhance their digital environments.

# Emerging Trends

Looking ahead to the next few years, unfolding trends that could take shape for the handheld 3D scanners market may be foreseen as including:

1. Integration with AI and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are increasingly playing a vital role in the 3D scanning industry. AI algorithms can help improve the accuracy of 3D models by enhancing data processing and analysis. Machine learning can also enable automation in the scanning process, thus making it faster and less error-prone.

2. Miniaturization and Portability

There is a growing demand for 3D scanners that are more compact and portable. Miniaturization of these devices will continue to provide users with greater flexibility and convenience in fieldwork and other jobs that must be done outdoors or in remote locations. Advances in miniaturization are making it possible to integrate powerful scanning capabilities into smaller, more accessible devices.

3. Enhanced User Interfaces

User experience is turning out to be the hub of handheld 3D scanner development. Advanced user interface designs with intuitive software and touchscreen operation are among other features that have been implemented in these devices. This trend is foreseen to continue as there is much effort in making 3D scanning technology friendly for a non-expert user.

4. Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Technologies

Sustainability has been of essence for every aspect of development within technology. Handheld 3D scanners are no exception, with manufacturers actively testing eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient technologies to reduce the environmental footprint of their products. This also directly corresponds with general trends in the technology and manufacturing world regarding sustainability.
